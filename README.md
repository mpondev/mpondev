### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mario Ponce

I'm a passionate self-taught fullstack web developer from Spain.

For more than 20 years I have been the manager of my own import company, but in 2015 I discovered HTML and I couldn't stop: behind it came CSS and JavaScript, Node, MongoDB...
While I may lack professional experience, my passion for technology along with my thirst for knowledge, has equipped me with a solid foundation in web development principles and practices.
